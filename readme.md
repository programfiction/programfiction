Hi, I am a seasoned Lead Software Engineer, Full Stack Developer, and Solution Architect with over 14 years of hands-on experience designing and developing scalable, enterprise-grade applications. Currently working as an AVP Senior Software Engineer at Wells Fargo, I lead and contribute to a 10-member Agile team, playing a key role in developing a Test-Driven Development (TDD) platform within the Banking domain.

I specialize in .NET technologies (C#, .NET 5, ASP.NET Core) and modern front-end frameworks like Angular 16, with strong expertise in RESTful APIs, Web Services, Entity Framework, and LINQ. I am proficient with databases including MSSQLServer, Oracle, SQL Lite, Azure SQL, as well as NoSQL databases like Cosmos DB and MongoDB.

I have 7+ years of experience in Azure Cloud Development and hold Microsoft AZ-204 and AZ-900 certifications. I have actively contributed to designing and deploying AI-based Proof of Concepts (POCs) and am currently exploring the integration of Generative AI (GenAI) into enterprise systems to enhance user productivity and operational intelligence.

My domain exposure spans Banking, HCM, Avionics, and APM. I‚Äôve also worked extensively on reporting and monitoring tools including Power BI, SSRS/SSDT, Application Insights, SonarLint, AppDynamics, and Splunk.

I am a PMP-certified project manager (35 hours of mandatory training completed) and have received several accolades for my leadership and performance, including multiple Associate of the Quarter awards.

AZ-204 & AZ-900 Certified Cloud Developer

Proficient in AI/ML concepts and Generative AI integrations
