# 🧮 Azure Pricing Calculator – Complete Notes

> A structured summary based on the video walkthrough of how to use the **Azure Pricing Calculator**, plan cloud costs, and estimate expenses effectively.

---

## 📊 1. Why Use the Azure Pricing Calculator?

The Azure Pricing Calculator helps you **estimate costs** for Azure resources **before deployment**.  
It’s essential for:
- Planning new deployments based on actual architecture.
- Forecasting costs for future workloads.
- Optimizing existing deployments with cost insights.

> ⚠️ **Garbage In, Garbage Out** – You need a clear architecture and accurate inputs for meaningful cost estimates.

## 🧠 2. Analyzing Existing Costs

If resources are already deployed, Azure provides **Cost Management & Billing** tools to analyze spending:

| Feature | Purpose |
|--------|----------|
| **Cost Analysis** | Overview of costs across subscriptions. |
| **Cost by Resource/Service** | Detailed cost breakdown by resource type. |
| **Daily Cost View** | Track spending trends over time. |
| **Pie Charts & Insights** | Visualize costs by resource groups, regions, and services. |
| **Budgets & Alerts** | Set spending limits and get notified when nearing thresholds. |
| **Log Analytics Insights** | Understand data ingestion and storage costs. |

---

## 🧱 3. Pre-requisites Before Using the Calculator

Before estimating, you must **understand the architecture** and **requirements**:

- ✅ Number of instances  
- ✅ Resource sizes and SKUs  
- ✅ Workload patterns (e.g., always-on vs. autoscaled)  
- ✅ Interactions between components  
- ✅ Hours of operation  
- ✅ Data transfer patterns  
- ✅ Retention policies and data churn

Also remember:
- Some resources (like **virtual networks** and **resource groups**) are free but can still **influence costs**.
- Certain services (like **Cosmos DB free tier**) include free usage but should be accounted for beyond free limits.

## 💡 4. Cost Drivers and Considerations

### 🖥️ Virtual Machines (VMs)

| Cost Factor | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| **VM SKU & Size** | Different series and sizes cost differently. |
| **Number of VMs** | More instances = higher cost. |
| **Running Hours** | Autoscaling or schedule-based usage affects monthly total. |
| **OS Licensing** | Affects price; can be reduced with Azure Hybrid Benefit or Dev/Test pricing. |

---

### 💽 Storage Costs

| Type | Considerations |
|------|-----------------|
| **OS Disk** | Required for each VM; typically Premium SSD (~128 GB). |
| **Data Disks** | Optional; multiple per VM; consider size, performance, and lifecycle. |
| **Snapshots** | Pay for delta changes stored. |
| **Backup** | Cost depends on data churn, retention, and replication (LRS/GRS). |
| **Managed Disks** | Premium or Ultra options; may include bursting costs. |

---

### 🔐 Security & Monitoring

| Service | Cost Drivers |
|--------|--------------|
| **Microsoft Defender** | Charged per resource (VM, Storage, SQL, etc.). |
| **Azure Monitor Logs** | Cost based on data ingested and retention > 31 days. |
| **Alerts** | Different pricing for metric vs. log-based alerts. |

---

### 🌐 Networking

| Component | Cost Notes |
|----------|------------|
| **VNet** | Free, but peering incurs ingress/egress charges. |
| **ExpressRoute** | Costs for gateway, circuit, and outbound data. |
| **Site-to-Site VPN** | Gateway and egress data charges apply. |
| **Public IPs** | Billed separately. |
| **Standard Load Balancer** | Paid based on usage. |
| **Egress Data** | Charges depend on path (Microsoft backbone vs ISP). |

---

### 🗄️ Other Azure Services

| Service | Cost Drivers |
|--------|--------------|
| **Storage Account** | SKU, replication, and data written. |
| **Databases** | Pricing models vary (provisioned vs serverless, replicas, etc.). |
| **Azure Site Recovery** | Protects VMs; charges apply per protected instance. |
| **Azure Firewall** | Scales with data throughput. |

## 🛠️ 5. Using the Azure Pricing Calculator

### Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Sign In** – Enables saving and sharing estimates.
2. **Start a New Estimate** – Create multiple estimates for different scenarios.
3. **Use Example Scenarios** – Prebuilt templates (e.g., CI/CD for containers) help identify required components.
4. **Add Products** – Search and add services like Virtual Machines, Storage, Defender, Backup, etc.
5. **Configure Parameters**:
   - Region (impacts pricing)
   - OS type (Windows/Linux)
   - Tier (Standard/Premium)
   - VM size and count
   - Estimated running hours
   - Reserved Instances or Hybrid Benefit (if applicable)
6. **Add Disks** – OS and data disks with size, performance, and count.
7. **Add Additional Components** – Defender, Backup, ExpressRoute, Load Balancer, Public IP, etc.
8. **Review & Adjust** – Reorder items, add SKUs and resource IDs, and review pricing assumptions.
9. **Add Support Plans or Licensing** – Enterprise Agreement (EA), Pay-as-you-go, etc.
10. **Save or Share Estimate** – Save to your account, generate a shareable URL, or export as Excel.

## 📉 Cost Optimization Tips

- Use **Reserved Instances** for predictable workloads.  
- Enable **Azure Hybrid Benefit** if you have existing Windows Server or SQL Server licenses.  
- Utilize **Auto-scaling** to reduce compute costs.  
- Monitor and adjust **data retention** in Log Analytics.  
- Consolidate VNets or use **Private Endpoints** wisely to reduce data transfer costs.  
- Regularly review **budgets and alerts**.

---

## 📦 Exporting and Sharing Estimates

Once done:
- 📤 **Save** your estimate to revisit or modify later.
- 🔗 **Share** via URL for collaboration with teammates or stakeholders.
- 📊 **Export to Excel** for detailed analysis and reporting.

---

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

The Azure Pricing Calculator is a powerful tool when combined with a **well-defined architecture** and **accurate workload understanding**.  
It’s not about blindly adding resources — it’s about knowing **what**, **how many**, **how long**, and **how they interact**.

> ✨ **Key Rule:** The more accurate your inputs, the more reliable your cost estimate.
