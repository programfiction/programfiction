## Az-305 Questions
---
1. You have an Azure solution that uses a virtual network, a storage account, and multiple virtual machines.
You need to recommend a solution to log information about IP traffic entering and leaving the virtual network.
Which type of logging solution should you recommend?

    * activity logs
    * Application Insights
    * Azure Storage Analytics
    * network security group (NSG) flow logs

    <details>
    <summary>Open Explanation</summary>
    NSG flow logs are used to log IP traffic information. Activity logs are used to log control plane events for individual Azure resources in a storage account, but it does not cover IP traffic. Application Insights logs data from applications. Azure Storage Analytics logs events related to storage accounts only.
    </details>

2. You have an on-premises Microsoft SQL Server solution that runs the following services:
SQL Server Database Engine
SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)
SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)
You need to migrate the solution to Azure. You must minimize costs and time to migrate.
What should you use?
    * Azure SQL Database
    * Azure SQL Managed Instance
    * Azure Synapse Analytics
    * SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines
    <details>
    <summary>Open Explanation</summary>
    SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines is the only option to maintain SSIS, SSAS, and SSRS. SQL Managed Instance and Azure SQL Database do not support SSIS, SSAS, and SSRS. Azure Synapse Analytics does not support the SQL Server Database Engine, SSIS, and SSRS.
