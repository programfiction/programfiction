It seems the PDF generation module is not available in this environment, so I cannot directly create the PDF file here.

Instead, I will provide the formatted content for the one-page handout. This content can be easily copied into any word processor or presentation software (like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or PowerPoint) and then exported as a PDF optimized for printing.

Azure Pricing Components â€“ At a Glance

Understanding Azure pricing involves evaluating several resource categories and business options impacting total cost.

Core Resource Components
- Virtual Machines (VMs): Charges depend on VM size, region, and usage hours.
- Storage Accounts: Based on stored data, redundancy, and transaction volume.
- Azure Backup: Calculated by backup size and retention period.
- Azure Monitor: Metered for log ingestion, metrics tracked, and alerting frequency.

Other Pricing Factors
- SKU/Region Choices: Resource type, capacity, and geographic region influence rates.
- Redundancy & Backup Options: Additional cost for geo-redundancy or long-term retention.
- Security Add-ons: Advanced services like Defender and network security features may increase spend.
- Networking: VPN gateways, bandwidth, and private connections impact cost.
- Support Plans: Tiered support (Basic, Standard, Premium) at varying price points.
- Resource Sharing: Resource pooling and sharing can optimize usage and manage costs.

Steps for Accurate Pricing
1. List all required Azure resources/services.
2. Pick SKUs, regions, and redundancy levels based on business needs.
3. Include monitoring, security, networking, and support needs.
4. Use the Azure Pricing Calculator for detailed, scenario-based estimates.

Tip: Regularly review cloud usage to avoid unexpected costs and optimize with reserved resources or sharing strategies.

## Az-305 Questions

1. You have an Azure solution that uses a virtual network, a storage account, and multiple virtual machines.
You need to recommend a solution to log information about IP traffic entering and leaving the virtual network.
Which type of logging solution should you recommend?

    * activity logs
    * Application Insights
    * Azure Storage Analytics
    * network security group (NSG) flow logs

    <details>
    <summary>Open Explanation</summary>
    NSG flow logs are used to log IP traffic information. Activity logs are used to log control plane events for individual Azure resources in a storage account, but it does not cover IP traffic. Application Insights logs data from applications. Azure Storage Analytics logs events related to storage accounts only.

2. You have an on-premises Microsoft SQL Server solution that runs the following services:
SQL Server Database Engine
SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)
SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)
You need to migrate the solution to Azure. You must minimize costs and time to migrate.
What should you use?
    * Azure SQL Database
    * Azure SQL Managed Instance
    * Azure Synapse Analytics
    * SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines
    <details>
    <summary>Open Explanation</summary>
    SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines is the only option to maintain SSIS, SSAS, and SSRS. SQL Managed Instance and Azure SQL Database do not support SSIS, SSAS, and SSRS. Azure Synapse Analytics does not support the SQL Server Database Engine, SSIS, and SSRS.
