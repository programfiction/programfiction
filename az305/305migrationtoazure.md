## üìò Overview & Summary

### High-level Migration Flow

1. **Spring-clean** ‚Äî Remove unused apps/data to reduce migration scope.
2. **Discover** ‚Äî Inventory servers, OS, apps, hardware, performance, dependencies.
3. **Assess** ‚Äî Right-size, group dependent systems, evaluate target services and feasibility.
4. **Migrate** ‚Äî Replicate (agentless or agent-based), test migration, cutover (online/offline).
5. **Optimize** ‚Äî Ongoing cost & performance optimizations after migration.

### Key Considerations

- **Business drivers:** Time, budget, ROI window, strategic importance.
- **Dependencies & latency:** Apps relying on sub-ms latency may need redesign.
- **The 5 R's:** Rehost, Refactor, Re-architect, Rebuild, Replace (SaaS).
- **Azure Migrate:** The central hub for discovery, assessment, and migration.
- **Data considerations:** Use Database Migration Service and compatibility checks.
- **Workload types:** VDI ‚Üí Windows Virtual Desktop, Large data ‚Üí Data Box, Web ‚Üí App Service Migration Assistant.
- **Testing:** Always run test migrations and plan downtime carefully.

## üõ†Ô∏è Azure Migration Practical Guide

### 0. Spring-clean
- Remove unused VMs, old file shares, and stale data before migration.

### 1. Discover
- Deploy Azure Migrate appliance:
  - OVA for VMware  
  - VHD for Hyper-V  
  - Installation package for physical/other hypervisors
- Capture:
  - OS and application inventory  
  - Hardware specs and performance counters  
  - Network dependencies
- Run discovery for days or weeks to capture peak and seasonal usage.

---

### 2. Assess
- Use Azure Migrate assessments to:
  - Right-size VM targets (based on 95th percentile, with padding).
  - Estimate cost and choose appropriate storage and regions.
  - Group dependent servers for co-migration.
  - Produce readiness and confidence ratings.
- Determine the best migration path per application using the **5 R‚Äôs**.

---

### 3. Migrate
- **Replication options:**
  - Agentless (VMware/Hyper-V snapshots) ‚Äî simpler, safer for production.
  - Agent-based (mobility service) ‚Äî for unsupported hypervisors or physical servers.
- Set up replication appliances: config server, process server as needed.
- Run **test migrations** to validate performance and functionality.
- Perform **final cutover**: shut down on-prem, finalize replication, and bring up workloads in Azure.

---

### 4. Optimize
- Post-migration:
  - Optimize VM sizes, storage tiers, and enable autoscaling.
  - Use reserved instances for cost optimization.
  - Refactor or re-architect strategic apps over time.
  - Monitor performance and costs continuously.

## üìã Migration Decision Checklist & 5 R's

### Decision Checklist (Per Application)

- How long do we have to migrate?
- Is the app strategic (lifecycle 1‚Äì5+ years)?
- What‚Äôs the budget and ROI tolerance?
- Are there dependencies that anchor it on-prem?
- What downtime is acceptable? (online vs offline migration)
- What is the data seasonality and monitoring period?
- Security, compliance, and data sovereignty requirements?

### 5 R's ‚Äì Migration Strategy

| Strategy | Description | Effort | Cloud-Native Benefit |
|----------|-------------|--------|-----------------------|
| **Rehost** | Lift-and-shift VM ‚Üí VM | ‚≠ê | ‚≠ê |
| **Refactor** | Minimal code change, move to managed platform | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Re-architect** | Modify application for cloud-native patterns | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Rebuild** | Recreate application from scratch | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Replace** | Move to SaaS alternative | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |

## üß∞ Tools & Tips

### Azure Migrate Hub
- Central hub for discovery, assessment, replication, and migration planning.
- Agentless discovery for VMware/Hyper-V.
- Supports Windows and Linux workloads.
- Integrates with partner tools for extended capabilities.

---

### Database Migration
- **Azure Database Migration Service**:  
  - Standard SKU ‚Äì free, basic functionality  
  - Premium SKU ‚Äì supports online replication
- Use **Database Migration Assistant** to check feature parity and compatibility before migration.

---

### VDI & Web Apps
- **VDI migrations** ‚Üí Windows Virtual Desktop (often partner-assisted).
- **Web apps** ‚Üí App Service Migration Assistant (for public-facing sites).
- **Large data** ‚Üí Azure Data Box for offline bulk transfers.

---

### Best Practices
- Capture sufficient performance history to right-size workloads accurately.
- Group dependent workloads to preserve latency-sensitive communication.
- Use agentless replication for safety where possible.
- Always run **test migrations** ‚Äî validate networking, DNS, and monitoring before final cutover.

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts

Migrating to Azure is more than a technical exercise ‚Äî it‚Äôs a strategic transformation.  
By following this structured approach ‚Äî **spring-clean ‚Üí discover ‚Üí assess ‚Üí migrate ‚Üí optimize** ‚Äî and making informed decisions using the **5 R‚Äôs**, organizations can modernize with confidence, reduce costs, and accelerate innovation.
